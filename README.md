# flutter_quiz_app
# Overview

This Flutter project is a simple quiz application designed to test users on a series of questions. The app consists of a start screen, multiple question screens, and a result screen. Users progress through the quiz by answering one question at a time and receive feedback on their performance at the end.

## Screens

### Start Screen

The initial screen welcomes users and prompts them to begin the quiz.

### Question Screens

Multiple screens, each presenting a single question along with multiple answer options. Users navigate through these screens to answer questions.

### Result Screen

The final screen displays a table summarizing the quiz results. The table includes columns for question number, question text, correct answer, and the user's selected answer. This provides a comprehensive overview of the user's performance throughout the quiz.

## Features

- **Sequential Question Flow**: Users progress through questions one at a time.
- **Result Summary**: A table at the end of the quiz summarizes each question, correct answers, and the user's responses.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Two buttons at the bottom of the result screen allow users to restart the quiz or exit the application.

## Usage

To run the app locally, ensure you have Flutter installed. Then, clone the repository and use the following commands:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
